# GnMap
Graduation Project - detect of genome misassembly




# Description
Our app gives new life for an old algorithm called "Detection of putative genome misassemblies." 
The old software for this algorithm is not useful anymore because it was written in old computer languages and can't be updated.
So our project uses a simpler method of comparing sequences that is easier for biologists to understand. 
The goal of the project is to help scientists study the evolution of genomes and understand how genes work.
